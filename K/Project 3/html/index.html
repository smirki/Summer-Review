            <div class="column">TL;DR: Modern BMWs are better cars to drive and own than modern Mercedes in nearly every single metric, and this breaks my Mercedes loving heart.

                As a bit of background, I have always loved Mercedes-Benz. They’re not quite up there with Porsche, but I’ve always held the brand in high regard. Consequently, I’ve looked forward to every new S-class release because it is the pinnacle of what the luxury full-size sedan segment should offer. Alternatively, my dad has always owned a BMW in some flavor for as long as I’ve been alive, and has consistently told me that he has a strong preference for BMW over Mercedes.
                
                Just from memory, my dad has owned the E39, E60, and F10 5-series; the E53 and E70 X5; and an F16 X6. And whenever he would get a new BMW, I would always rib him about how Mercedes was better for X, Y, or Z reasons. I think the W124 is one of the greatest cars ever made, and absolutely loved the face lifted W203 C-class. He strongly disagreed, but that was our shtick for a long time. Nevertheless, I always enjoyed driving his cars whenever I would get the opportunity, but I always wished it was a Mercedes in the back of my head.
                
                This year, as a result of my dad’s long-standing relationship with our local BMW dealer, when it came time to get my wife a new car in this insane market, my dad was able to find an X3 sDrive30i for a really, really good lease rate. This would be her first German car after years of driving poverty spec American cars, like her Sebring with its broken top and nonfunctioning AC, her two Darts, and the electronic plague that was her Compass. And despite my “dislike” for BMW, I absolutely love her car. It drives incredibly well for its size, it’s very quiet and comfortable, the transmission tuning is chef’s kiss, and the power delivery never leaves me wishing for a better torque curve. When she left for a week for business, I said I’d drive her car for a few days and ended up driving it all week. And this is just the X3 sDrive30i! The car drives so well that it made me seriously consider leasing an X3M which would be both the first automatic and SUV I would willingly spend my money on. This is coming from a guy that’s driven manual transmission sports cars for the last 18 years (tangentially, that’s a scary realization).</div>
